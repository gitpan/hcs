1.07 - Fri Mar 11 23:56:00 2005
	* Added POD coverage tests, fixed issues
	* no code updates: no need to upgrade

1.06 - Mon Sep 20 20:13:09 2004
* updated to work with the latest Mac::PropertyList, which has a new
interface

1.03 - Thu Nov 27 06:56:07 2003
HTTP::Cookies::Safari now uses Date::Calc instead of Date::Manip.
This should make date calculations much faster. 

No bugs were fixed, but this should be a performance boost.

	* now handles expiry times

1.01 - Tue Jan  7 23:54:19 2003
